### Home 

**Main section**. Here you will find direct access to some of my networks and the presentation of the web page.

### Sobre mí

Here you will find **information about me**: short presentation and skills. 

### Proyectos

Here you will find **information about the projects** I have done so far. Each card has a **direct link to the GitHub repository** **and** to **the web page**. 

### Contacto

Here you will find direct access to my **social networks to contact me**. 

## 🛠️ Tools

The following tools have been used when solving the project:

- **HTML** (with partials for an easier lecture and project organization)
- **CSS/Sass**
- **Partials**
- **Variables, mixins and functions**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Box model** (size, padding and margin)
- **Media queries**
- **Position**
- **Transition**
- **GIT version control**

## 💾 Steps to follow to use this project on your computer:

> **NOTE:** You need to have **Node JS** installed to run this project.

1. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
2. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.
3. Open it in your code editor.
4. Open a terminal and **install the local dependencies** by executing in the command terminal. Here are the ones I used to start my project:

```bash
npm install
```

The project has to be **started** every time we start programming, to do this we will execute the **command**:

```bash
npm start
```
After running `npm start` we can start editing all the files inside the src/ folder and program comfortably 💫
